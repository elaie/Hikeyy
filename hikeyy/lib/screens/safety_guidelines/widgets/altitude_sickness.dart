Should it occur it will often be above 8,000 ft and may manifest itself in either AMS – Acute Mountain Sickness, or the more serious conditions HACE and/or HAPE. Altitude illness should always be taken serious as ignoring it may ultimately lead to death. In most instances, however, listening to the body and taking the necessary preventative measures, as outlined below, will entirely prevent AMS from occurring, or remove it, if occurred.'),

Even if you’ve not ascended more than 300 m but still feel a headache, tiredness or any other of the above listed altitude sickness symptoms, always take a rest day to further acclimatize. Moreover, keep on drinking enough water so as to stay hydrated. Proper hydration helps to prevent altitude sickness. Please therefore also always stay away from alcohol when trekking. The general water drinking guideline is to drink 1 liter of water per 1,000 m. To exemplify, if at 4,000 m then 4 liter of water should be consumed per day, if at 5,000 m then 5 liter of water etc. Another recommended way to prevent altitude sickness is the use of Diamox (Acetazolamide) pills so as to speed up the acclimatization. As soon as you ascend more than 3,000 m you can start taking 1 pill per day. Alternatively only take Diamox pills if starting to feel any of the altitude sickness symptoms.'),
